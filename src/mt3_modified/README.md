All files in this directory were imported and modified from the [Magenta MT3 library](https://github.com/Magenta/mt3).
They have been modified with mostly removals so that I could import just the functions I needed without also requiring heavy
and incompatible upstream dependencies, such as the T5X library which has incompatible dependencies with M1 Macs.

The MT3 library is Apache 2.0 licensed, and this serves as my notice that the files have been modified.
